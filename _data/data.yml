career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: Born and raised in Madrid (Spain), I started my tech career following my desire to continuously broaden and deepen my knowledge in research. In addition, I am passionate about graphic design, illustration, and sketching. Web development allows me to combine both tech and art, getting the most out of my expertise in both areas. I am looking forward to becoming a Full Stack Developer (UX / UI, Front-End, and Back-end) to put into practice this synergy. Also, I enjoy participating in Open Source Projects, Hackathons, and contributing to Programming Community.
