I"Ê<p>Born and raised in Madrid (Spain), I started my tech career in research following my desire to continously broaden and deepen my knowledge. In addition, I am passionate about graphic design, illustration, and sketching. Web development allows me to combine both tech and art, getting the most out of my expertise in both areas. I am looking forward to become a Full Stack Developer (UX / UI, Front-End and Back-end) to put into practice this synergy.</p>
